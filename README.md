EasyiAP
=======

A helper class to help doing In app purchases in iOS MUCH easier and faster. EasyiAP contains 3 classes:
- DefaultInitializer : NSObject    // this class provides a "+ (id) shared" function for easy subclassing
- iAPManager : DefaultInitializer  // Manages iAPs
- iAPProduct                       // A class to contain your iAP Product for simplistic use and storage

#### Crash Course
In this crash course we'll assume your working in a UIViewController getting it ready to act as a purchase page for a iAP.
